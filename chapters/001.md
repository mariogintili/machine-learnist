# About artificial intelligence

So, what are AI programs known as?

They're called *Inteligent agents*, they:

- Have sensors
- Have a state
- Perceive an input from the environment, and act on it.

AI is the art of making a decision based on the passed data. This cycle is called **"Perception action cycle"**.

## AI in finance

AI agents used as trading agents, they look at events in the market and make decisions on it: how to buy, how much, when, when to sell, which commodity to acquire, etc.

## AI in robotics

Well, you've seen [Boston Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY) right?

## AI in games

Hundres of implementations, like enemies in [Metal Gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCgCjPYi27Q)

## AI in medicine

Agents that [help you diagnose](http://www.openclinical.org/aiinmedicine.html)!

# Terminology

## Fully observable environments

Fully observable environments are those who provide all the information to make the ultimate choice: like counting cards in blackjack.

## Partially observable environments

Partially observable environments are those who's acting agents need to look back at previous gathered data in a "game" or "cycle" in order to make the optimal decision: like guessing the area a football player will aim to on a penalty kick.
