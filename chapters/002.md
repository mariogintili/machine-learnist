# Titanic model

The first (optional) project is a series of small exercises using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

The project consists of booting the notebook and going through a small set of programming exercises that allow you to "tweak"
the accuracy of a function that's making a prediction. To some extent you could debate said function mimics the behaviour of a [Decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) in supervised learning.

I found this exercise to be very light but a really nice introduction of how things are going to look moving forwards. Data visualization plays a big fat role in applied ML,
since you'll come up with better questions after looking at the data

Something important to highlight for the final exercise is to correctly assess the value of an extra IF statement vs the margins it produces,
for example you might have come up with a combination of features that yield a 98% accuracy...however this features might only be true for less than 1% of the
sample at hand making the model completely useless. Those are my 2 cents :confetti_ball:

## Troubleshooting

Here's a list of the known :poop: I came across while doing this project.

#### Random module errors

This set of exercises where written in a [procedural way](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1870177/how-do-i-get-out-of-the-habit-of-procedural-programming-and-into-object-oriented). Some modules that are required
on the last set of exercises are actually loaded once you execute the scripts from the first ones, so remember to run everything top to bottom when you boot the notebook.

#### `ValueError` on the `survival_stats` function

This is caused by having the most recent version of Numpy `1.11.0` instead of `1.10.4` in which NaN values seem not to be coerced to a numeric by default.
In order to fix this without having to re-install/downgrade/upgrade any of your dependencies open your `titanic_visualizations.py`, jump to line 75 and add the following line:

```python
 # 'Numerical' features
 if(key == 'Age' or key == 'Fare'):

        # this is the line you want to add
        all_data = all_data[~np.isnan(all_data[key])]
```

Happy coding :godmode:
