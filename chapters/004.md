Make a list of all the things that should be taken in consideration when looking at data, i.e: do I care about false alarms? why?

- Why is the recall important?

Recall


- Why is the precision rate important?

# Formulas - but not really

*Precision*

```ruby
# ruby

class Matrix

  def recall(row)
    max(row) / row.reduce(:+)
  end

  def precision(row)
    max(row) / self.transpose[row].inject(:+)
  end
end
```
