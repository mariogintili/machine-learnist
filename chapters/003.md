# Model Evaluation and validation

The most important thing is that you decide with data first! and ML uses it to enhance a decision. After that work's done is important
to have success metrics that will help you guide the way.

The rest of this chapter will have a refresher series covering basic statistics and end up in another model that will be done by us from 0. This is exciting.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Research the following:

- The mode (the most common value) Which does not occur at all times. Or more than once in the same series(like a bi-modal distribution)
- The average
- The median
- Inferential statistics
- Robustness (statistics)
