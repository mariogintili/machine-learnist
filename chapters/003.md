# Model Evaluation and validation

The most important thing is that you decide with data first! and ML uses it to enhance a decision. After that work's done is important
to have success metrics that will help you guide the way.

The rest of this chapter will have a refresher series covering basic statistics and end up in another model that will be done by us from 0. This is exciting.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Research the following:

- The mode (the most common value) Which does not occur at all times. Or more than once in the same series(like a bi-modal distribution)
- The average
- The median
- Inferential statistics
- Robustness (statistics)
- Outlier
- Data range
- Quartile: remember to split the data in half, and then again :smiley:
- IQR


# What I'm really meant to be learning

The most important bit for me as a professional is to develop frameworks and/or processes around are craft. This way
improving is *a lot* easier and work can be more than enjoyable, for this particular chapter I will make a list of all those nuggets of knowledge and
try to find supporting evidence for it:

- Data scrubbing is the most important part
- Get rid of outliers, cut the tails! Data scientists usually cut the lower 25% and the upper 25% of the data values
