# Model Evaluation and validation

The most important thing is that you decide with data first! and ML uses it to enhance a decision. After that work's done is important
to have success metrics that will help you guide the way.

The rest of this chapter will have a refresher series covering basic statistics and end up in another model that will be done by us from 0. This is exciting.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Research the following:

- [The mode](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm) (the most common value) Which does not occur at all times. Or more than once in the same series(like a bi-modal distribution)
- [The average](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm)
- [The median](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm)
- [Inferential statistics](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/statinf.php)
- [Robustness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) (statistics)
- [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier) `Outlier > Q1 - (1.5 * IQR)` or `Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)`
- [Data range](http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/vol8/range.html)
- [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) - remember to split the data in half, and then again :smiley:
- [IQR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) (Interquartile Range)
- [Boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)
- [Descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics)
- [Average absolute deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_absolute_deviation)
- [Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) (Average square deviation)
- [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
- [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
- [Data binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning)

# What I'm really meant to be learning

The most important bit for me as a professional is to develop frameworks and/or processes around the craft.

This way improving is *a lot* easier and work can be more than enjoyable :) for this particular chapter I will make a list of all those nuggets of knowledge and try to find supporting evidence for it:

- Data scrubbing is the most important part
- Get rid of outliers, cut the tails! Data scientists usually cut the lower 25% and the upper 25% of the data values
